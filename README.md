# jeteclipse

This directory contains the jet eclipse code as used in Maccarone, van den Eijnden, Russell and Degenaar.  The code may be used by anyone as is, but it remains copyrighted and modifications may be done only with permission of Maccarone.

It is standard FORTRAN77, and should compile with a simple command line entry with no libraries needed.
